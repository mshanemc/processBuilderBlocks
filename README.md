Apex classes with invocable methods to allow Process Builder and Flows to do more stuff than what comes out of the box.

###Demo Video of all the components (except the last, newest ones)

Contents:
###Delete (PBBDelete) [Vid shortcut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJvga1rFFsA&t=45s)

**Why**: the thing you've always wanted to do from declarative workflow!

* pass it a record Id, and whatever that is gets deleted
* doesn't check for delete permissions or anything like that
* doesn't handle any errors that may occur
* use with caution.  Your process could have users deleting themselves and crazy stuff like that.

###"Manually" share records (PBBSharing) [Vid shortcut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJvga1rFFsA&t=234s)

**Why**: you have sharing rules that are more complex than what the declarative sharing rules provide for

 * pass it a record Id, a user/group id, and an optional access level and it creates the sharing
 * known to support custom objects and some permutations of account (there's lots of complexity on account and I haven't tested them all)
 * I didn't write a test for this one--there's not guarantee that an org will have any __c custom object that this stuff depends on.

###Assign Permission Sets to Users (PBBAddPermSet) [Vid shortcut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJvga1rFFsA&t=522s)

**Why**: You use permission sets, and assign them based on rules about the user/profile/etc.  Automate that!

 * pass it a permission set id and a user id, and it assigns that permission set to the user 
 * uses an @future method to avoid mixed DML issues
 * There is a test class for this one, because every org will have PermissionSets available. 
 * Because I did the testing, it's all nicely bulkified

###Refresh a Dashboard (PBBDashboardRefresh) [Vid shortcut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJvga1rFFsA&t=650s)

**Why**: You want to refresh a dashboard when stuff happens, like refreshing your opportunity dashboard after someone edits an opportunity so that anyone who views it has the latest and greatest data

 * Requires a remote site setup for self-calls (ex: if you're na16.salesforce.com, then there's a remote site for that)
 * no error handling--fails silently if the call gets 401, 404, bad request, limits hit, etc
 * does handle bulk scenarios (built in batching)
 * no tests since I can't programmatically create a dashboard OR make callouts to get your actual dashboards from apex test

###Give a Thanks Badge (GiveWorksThanksAction) [Vid shortcut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJvga1rFFsA&t=865s)

**Why**: Give badges when people do something...for example, marking an opportunity closed/won that's above a certain $ amount or getting perfect scores on a customer satisfaction survey.

* Requires that work.com thanks be enabled (it's free, just turn it on in the setup menu)
* Specify the badge name, who it's from, the thanks message, and who it's to
* this creates the thanks and posts it to chatter

###Apex debug (no video yet)

**Why**: It's hard to see what's going on in Process Builder sometimes.  You just want to write a debug statement, right?

* you pass it a simple string
* you can make it "formula" so that you can log information from the objects involved

###Apex Lock/Unlock records (no video yet)

**Why**: When a record gets to a certain stage, you just want to lock/unlock it.  You used to have to create a dummy approval process and auto-submit to achieve this.

* **You MUST activate a setting to allow this (it's under Process Automation Settings in setup)**
* you pass it the record Id that you want to lock

###Chatter Follow [Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1Me5QFil1w)

**Why**: Some event happens, and you want people to follow a record based on some criteria.  

* you pass it the recordId and the UserID of who you want to follow it
* Apex generics, so it works for any object
* it's actually smart enough to just ignore that request if Chatter isn't on, OR if that object doesn't have a chatter feed 

###Lead Assignment Rules re-run [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwWUxKYIhco)

**Why**: Some event happens, and you want to re-evaluate the lead assignment rules that usually only run on create

* you pass it the recordId of the leads that you want the rules to run for
* it runs your default (ie, the active) lead assignment rule
* If you pass it recordIds of something that's not a lead, it just ignores it
